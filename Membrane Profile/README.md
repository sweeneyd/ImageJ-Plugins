# ImageJ-Plugins
Various plugins for ImageJ developed to quickly process multiple images quickly.

#LeicaNCR
Calculates cellular properties (cell radius, nuclear radius, etc.) from batches of images of cells with the nuclear stains in one image channel and the cytoplasmic stains in another.

#PIBFelectroporation
Overlays brightfield images with a corresponding image thresholded using the Yen thresholding method as implemented in Fiji, , flattens, and saves images for later processing. 

#Membrane Profile
Membrane profile is the functional version of the .ijm profile from the supplementary data included as a .PDF in 

Sinha, Suwan Kumar, et al. "Mechanism of induction of NK activation by 2B4 (CD244) via its cognate ligand." The Journal of Immunology 185.9 (2010): 5205-5210.

This file is not my own work, simply a functional implementation of the text file given in the above work.
